AT+GATTCHARRAW
This read only command reads binary (instead of ASCII) data from a characteristic. It is non-printable but has less overhead and is easier when writing libraries in Arduino.

Parameters: The numeric ID of the characteristic to display the data for

Output: Binary data corresponding to the specified characteristic.
Note: This is a specialized command and no NEWLINE is present at the end of the command!
